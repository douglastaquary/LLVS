  s.description  =  <<-DESC
                    Ever wish it was as easy to move your app's data around as it is to push and pull 
                    your source code with a tool like Git? 
                    
                    LLVS works like a standard key-value store, except that it attaches a version to
                    every piece of stored data â€” it forms a complete history of changes. 
                    Just as with Git, you can retrieve the values for 
                    any version, determine the differences between two versions, 
                    and merge divergent versions.
                    
                    LLVS is also decentralized: you can send and receive versions from other stores, 
                    in the same way that you push and pull from other repositories with Git.
